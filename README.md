# Safe_Password 

This website is designed to use user inputs to generate a random password using Javascript. Users click the button, and are asked how long the password should be, and then a series of questions, asking individually to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and nummbers. The password is then generated on the screen for the user to copy. 

For example, if somebody wants to include 10 characters in the password, the result looks like this:
